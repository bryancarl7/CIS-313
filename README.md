# Data Structures: #
All of the Java Data Structures I wrote in CIS 313.


# Lab 0 #
Lab 0 is am implementation of Mergesort on arrays using only Java generics.
Lab0 can be ran on the command line after being compiled:

1) javac lab0.java 

2) java lab0



# Lab 1 #
A simple implementation of Stacks and Queues. It is ran and compiled using the same method as above. 
It also includes a node class to help serve the generics. This time you will run testcontents.java:

1) javac testcontents.java 

2) java testcontents



# Lab 2 #
A crucial implementation of a Binary Search Tree data structure again using Java generics. This time there is an inSample.txt file to use as input.
It will be ran like this now:

1) javac lab2.java 

2) java lab2 < inSample.txt



# Lab 3 # 
Lab 3 is ran the same way as lab2 and it is a priority queue implementation that has a MaxHeap do the heavy lifting on the backend
Again it is ran with the commands:

1) javac Lab3.java 

2) java lab3 < inSample.txt



# Lab 4 #
Lab 4 is a Red Black Tree in Java generics. This was a huge pain to write but I have a great appreciation for Red Black Trees now.
Ran just the same as before:

1) javac lab4.java 

2) java lab4 < inSample.txt
